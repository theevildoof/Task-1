# Pissbot 9000

| Part of the Pipeline| Feasability| Advantages | Disadvantages | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
| Camera System to detect the cup | Easy to use | Widely available and easy to use| Takes time and skill to set up|
| Robot dog                       | Costly      | uses cutting edge technology    | Expensive to repair/debug hardware faults |
| API to control robot            | Easy to Read | Can be hacked to fulfill own purposes | Okayish API documentation|
| Valve to piss beer              | Possible to make with servo motors | low cost, easy to start with | loose wiring could make debugging difficullt|

### Better Approach: 
 After pissing beer, if the dog is given a sense of space, it could possibly reduce tipping over the cup.
 
 Using a pressure valve to control air pressure from the tank could improve accuracy.
 
 Using some code to detect surface friction could improve wallking easier in wet surfaces.
 


# Automatic pool stick vs. strangers

| Part of the Pipeline| Feasability| Advantages | Disadvantages | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  Camera System |easy to program|Widely available and easy to use|Camera distortion, lens distortion|
| Shot Selection Allgorithm | Extremely difficult to program unless an expert| Great for figuring out how to position the cue and what force to apply|Hard for beginners|
|  Pool Cue with Robotic Tip| Steward Platform is difficult to make|Has multi-axis degree of freedom to play a variety of shots| Could get bulky,Lots of moving parts, Cables are driven using tension so possiblity of breaking exists, height of cue from table is unknown|
| Power tank | Easy to build a microcontroller | Easy to program | Hard to debug if a lot of connections are to be made|
|  Fiducial marker|Easy and cheap to make| Easy for a computer to pick out from an image| None that's concerning|

### Better Approach:

Centering the system could help in reducing camera distortion

Calibrating should reduce lens distortion
