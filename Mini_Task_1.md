# 5. MeArm - Your Robot

[Link](https://hackaday.io/project/181-mearm-your-robot)

### **Project Description :**

The MeArm project aims to bring a simple Robot Arm well within the reach and budget of the average educator, student, parent or child. The MeArm is an Open Sourced Robot Arm. It's small, like pocket sized and that's for a reason. It can be cut entirely from an A4 (or more accurately 300x200mm) sheet of acrylic and built with 4 cheap hobby servos.

### **Improvements :**

Multiple arms could essentialy improve the number of use cases

# 10. Custom wide format plotter

[Link](https://hackaday.io/project/713-custom-wide-format-plotter)

### **Project Description :**

The project uses custom software written in Python and NodeJS for the image processing and PHP / HTML / CSS / Javascript for the online webserver. The software accepts images in the most popular formats such as JPG, GIF, BMP, PNG and then transforms it into an SVG preview, PNG preview and also produces the actual plotter instructional file that is used by the machine to actually draw the artwork. This way, it can produce accurate previews prior to printing and it also allows us to experiment with different grids and drawing techniques. Currently it is drawing four layers per artwork
