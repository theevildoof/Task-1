# Pissbot 9000

Sequence in which it works:

Camera system --> Onboard Computer --> robot dog computer --> beer valve

How to Start Testing / Find which one is causing the Error ??

Individually test the four components to figure out if they are responsive

Does the onboard computer light up?

If NO ? the module which does not glow have been shorted and will not work anymore, Don't worry you can always order one online.

Found Some Module / IC to be hot ?

Not so Great news !! You would have burnt it.

Test the camera system individually to make sure it outputs data well

Make sure the onboard computer is able to receive and process the data

Make sure you have written a good algorithm to figure out the cup's position.(e.g. against same colored background, etc)

Make sure the dog's computer receives the data sent by the onboard computer and is able to process it

Make sure the beer valve's servo motors are working properly
 

# Automatic Pool Stick with Strangers

Sequence in which it works:

Camera system --> Computer --> Power tank --> Pool Cue microcontroller

Individually test the four components to figure out if they are responsive

Does the Power tank computer and the pool cue microcontroller light up?

If NO ? the module which does not glow have been shorted and will not work anymore, Don't worry you can always order one online.

Found Some Module / IC to be hot ?

Not so Great news !! You would have burnt it.

Does the camera system work?

If no, get a new one

Is your computer powerful enough to handle both the data in, algo and data out part succesfully?

If no, get a better computer

Make sure the camera system is centred around the pool table

Make sure to account for lens distortion

Make sure to calibrate the camera system using fiducial markers

Make sure the pool stick end is moving as expected

Make sure the pressure by the power tank matches the expected pressure
